# Roadmap

Status legend: ✅ shipped · 🚧 in progress · 🔭 planned

This roadmap is intentionally honest. Anything not marked ✅ is **not** in the product yet.

## ✅ Shipped (v1)

- **Self-hosted deploy** — single artifact (`package/app.js`, CommonJS Express, zero `npm install`),
  runs on any Node 18+ host; honors numeric `PORT` or a Unix socket path (Passenger/Hostinger).
- **Onboarding + ownership** — first-run admin setup, 5-word recovery phrase, brute-force lockout.
- **Built-in AI builder** — conversational tool-using agent loop (read → edit → self-correct →
  iterate); bring your own OpenAI-compatible key (OpenAI/DeepSeek/Groq/OpenRouter/Together/Mistral).
- **External agent operation** — token-gated REST API, MCP server (`/mcp` + stdio wrapper),
  OpenAPI schema (`/openapi.json`), and `skill.md`.
- **Safe editing** — Site Model + addressable patch engine, validate-before-commit, version
  history, one-click rollback, immutable framework core + footer.
- **Design system** — 12 block types, 7 themes, ~19 effects, sanitized custom-CSS layer.
- **App features** — declarative data collections + auto CRUD, media hosting, sandboxed
  (`vm`) server functions, multi-page sites, auto sitemap/robots/llms.txt.

## ✅ Shipped (since v1)

- **Provider-agnostic AI** — adapter layer (OpenAI-compatible, Anthropic, Gemini, local
  Ollama/LM Studio/vLLM, custom); env + dashboard config; `sophia ai:*` commands.
- **Extensions / plugins** — manifest + lifecycle, 13 scoped permissions, hook bus, routes,
  admin-nav, settings, **safe-patch-only** site access, and audit logging. Example + SEO-suite stub.
- **Audit logging** — append-only log of writes + extension actions (`/api/sophia/audit`).
- **Templates gallery** — 10 validated starter apps + `sophia template` commands.
- **`sophia` CLI** — `init · dev · doctor · build · package · template · backup · restore · deploy · ai:*`.
- **CI/CD** — GitHub Actions for test / build / package / security / release.

## 🚧 In progress / next

- **VEX — live preview pane in the builder** — split-screen chat + real-time preview that updates via
  SSE as you edit, with optimistic preview, changed-element highlighting, and Apply / Discard.
- **Vector memory for the builder** — semantic retrieval over past edits, templates, and docs to give
  the AI builder long-term context (optional; off without embeddings).
- **Sophia SEO Suite** — the first major extension (built in a separate repo against the
  [extension contract](docs/extensions/sophia-seo-suite-contract.md)).

## 🔭 Planned

- **Scoped API keys** — read-only / write / admin roles beyond the current editor+admin split.
- **Extension admin-panel rendering** (`adminEntry`) + **install/uninstall CLI** + background jobs.
- **`ai.stream()` / `ai.embed()`** for the built-in builder and extensions.
- **Backup export/import** beyond the current `sophia backup/restore`.
- **Hardened sandbox** — optional `isolated-vm` backend for stricter function isolation.
- **Per-function auth + rate limiting** for public `/api/fn/*` endpoints.
- **Live preview pane** in the builder.
- **Hosted "Sophia AI" option** — managed inference so non-technical users don't bring a key.
- **Shipped Docker image** and one-click deploy buttons.
